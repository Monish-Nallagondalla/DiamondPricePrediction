# Diamond Price Prediction  

An end-to-end machine learning project for predicting diamond prices based on various attributes like carat, cut, color, and clarity.  

## Project Overview  
This project leverages machine learning models to predict diamond prices with high accuracy. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using regression techniques. The project is implemented with Flask for deployment, Python for backend processing, and Jupyter notebooks for analysis.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains the following attributes:  
- `id`: Unique identifier for each diamond  
- `carat`: Weight of the diamond  
- `cut`: Quality of the diamond's cut  
- `color`: Diamond color grading  
- `clarity`: Diamond clarity grading  
- `depth`: Total depth percentage  
- `table`: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point  
- `x`: Length in mm  
- `y`: Width in mm  
- `z`: Depth in mm  
- `price`: Price of the diamond
