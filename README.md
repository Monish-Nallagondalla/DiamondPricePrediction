# Diamond Price Prediction

## Overview
This is an end-to-end project for predicting diamond prices based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, dimensions (x, y, z), and price. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models and provides a web application interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for building the web interface.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Such as scikit-learn for building predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each diamond.
- `carat`: Weight of the diamond.
- `cut`: Quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- `color`: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best).
- `clarity`: A measurement of how clear the diamond is.
- `depth`: Total depth percentage, calculated as 2*z/(x+y).
- `table`: Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
- `x`, `y`, `z`: Dimensions of the diamond in mm.
- `price`: Price of the diamond in US dollars.

## Model Training

### Performance Metrics:
The following models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Linear Regression**
    - RMSE: 1013.90 
    - MAE: 674.03 
    - R² Score: 93.69 

2. **Lasso Regression**
    - RMSE: 1013.88 
    - MAE: 675.07 
    - R² Score: 93.69 

3. **Ridge Regression**
    - RMSE: 1013.91 
    - MAE: 674.06 
    - R² Score: 93.69 

4. **ElasticNet**
    - RMSE: 1533.42 
    - MAE: 1060.74 
    - R² Score: 85.56 

These metrics indicate that Linear Regression and Lasso Regression performed best among the models tested.
